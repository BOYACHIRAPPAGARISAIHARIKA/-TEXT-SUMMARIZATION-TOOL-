# Text Summarization Tool

## Overview
The **Text Summarization Tool** is a Python-based script that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to generate concise summaries from lengthy articles. This tool is designed to extract key points while maintaining the original meaning of the text.

## Features
- Summarizes long-form text into short, meaningful summaries
- Utilizes NLP techniques for high-quality text abstraction
- Accepts text input from files or direct user input
- Provides output in a structured format

## Installation
To use this tool, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-summarization-tool.git
cd text-summarization-tool

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the script with an input text file or paste the text directly:

```bash
python summarizer.py --input "input.txt" --output "summary.txt"
```

Alternatively, use interactive mode:

```bash
python summarizer.py
```
You will be prompted to enter text, and the tool will generate a summary.
